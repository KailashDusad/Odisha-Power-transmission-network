# Optimizing Load Distribution in Power Transmission Networks through Demographic and Geographical Analysis

## Introduction 

Optimizing load distribution in power transmission networks is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable electricity delivery. This project focuses on analyzing demographic and geographical data to identify strategies for balancing load distribution across high and low-population areas and improving overall network resilience.

### Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of population distribution on the stability and load distribution of the power network in Odisha, India. Specific goals include:

- Identifying strategies to mitigate load imbalances
- Enhancing network efficiency and reliability through optimal node placement
- Analyzing demographic and load patterns to propose strategic interventions

## Summary

Power distribution network optimization involves strategic load redistribution and the establishment of new network nodes to balance demand across high and low-population areas. By analyzing demographic and load patterns in Odisha, India, we propose interventions to improve network efficiency and reliability.

Our findings suggest that strategic node placement and load-sharing mechanisms can significantly enhance network stability and efficiency. By integrating demographic information into network planning, power distribution systems can become more reliable and flexible, leading to better service for all communities.

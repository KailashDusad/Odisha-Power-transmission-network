# Optimizing Load Distribution in Power Transmission Networks through Demographic and Geographical Analysis

## Introduction 

Optimizing load distribution in power transmission networks is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable electricity delivery. This project focuses on analyzing demographic and geographical data to identify strategies for balancing load distribution across high and low-population areas and improving overall network resilience.

## Summary

Optimizing load distribution in power transmission networks is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable electricity delivery. This project focuses on analyzing demographic and geographical data to identify strategies for balancing load distribution across high and low-population areas and improving overall network resilience.

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of population distribution on the stability and load distribution of the power network in Odisha, India, focusing on identifying strategies to mitigate load imbalances and improve overall network resilience.

By analyzing Odisha's population distribution and load patterns, we show that we can identify nodes with high population weight that experience significant load demands and propose strategic interventions such as optimal node placement and load-sharing mechanisms to enhance network efficiency and reliability.

Our study on this project shows that geographical closeness to distribute power only partially addresses today's complex power needs. In Odisha, strategically placing new nodes and adjusting loads based on population can significantly improve network stability and efficiency, moving beyond older methods that manage population factors.

These results can help improve power distribution worldwide, particularly in fast-growing areas. By using population information in network planning, power plants can build more reliable and flexible systems, leading to fewer power outages and better service for all kinds of communities.
